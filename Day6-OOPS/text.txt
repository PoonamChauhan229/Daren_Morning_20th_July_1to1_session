How you classes in Javascript

}

Classname=>userdefined

class Car{
///properties
}

Car=>propertries/features
=>speed
=>fuel
=>color
=>brand name
=>launch year
=>with AC / witout AC
=>seaters
=>with musicsys/ without musicsys
=>with sunroof/ without sunroof
=>etc.................

touch and feel => that becomes the propertries of the class


you will have create object of that class=> instance of that class

with new keyword

var s1=new Car()

XXXXXXXX
var s2= new Bike()
XXXXXXXXXX

s1=>is the reference variable


Constructor:

Constructor are nothing but the specail way of assigning the values to the object

Assign values=> Constructor

declared=> using "constructor" keyword

constructor(){
    ///properties
}

Represent:

Task:

Class - Movie
The class Movie is stated below.
An instance of class Movie represents a film.
This class has the following three properties:

title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)

a) Write a constructor for the class Movie,
 which takes a String representing the title of the movie, 
 a String representing the studio, and a String representing 
 the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class
 properties to these values.

b) The constructor for the class Movie will 
set the class property rating to "PG" 
as default when no rating is provided.

c) Write a method getPG,
 which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, 
 and returns a new array of only those movies in the 
 input array with a rating of "PG". 
 You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. 
 The returned array need not be full.

d) Write a piece of code that creates
 an instance of the class Movie with 
the title “Casino Royale”, 
the studio “Eon Productions”,
 and the rating “PG­13”
